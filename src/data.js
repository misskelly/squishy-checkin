"no": "Phone a friend, crisis line, 911"

"Are you afraid you might hurt yourself or others?"
"911, crisis line"


"Is (your inner asshole) giving you shit again?"
"tell them to fuck off"

"question": "Are you hydrated?"
"answer": "  If not, have a glass of water."


"question": "Have you eaten in the past three hours?"
"answer": "If not, get some food — something with protein, not just simple carbs.  Perhaps some nuts or hummus?"


"question": "Have you showered in the past couple of days?"
"answer": "If not, take a shower right now."

"question": "If daytime: are you dressed?"
"answer": "If not, put on clean clothes that aren’t pajamas.  Give yourself permission to wear something special, whether it’s a funny t-shirt or a pretty dress."

"question": "If nighttime: are you sleepy and fatigued but resisting going to sleep?"
"yes": "Put on pajamas, make yourself cozy in bed with a teddy bear and the sound of falling rain, and close your eyes for fifteen minutes — no electronic screens allowed.  If you’re still awake after that, you can get up again; no pressure."
"no": "next question"

"question": "Have you stretched your legs in the past day?"
"answer": "If not, do so right now.  If you don’t have the spoons for a run or trip to the gym, just walk around the block, then keep walking as long as you please.  If the weather’s crap, drive to a big box store (e.g. Target) and go on a brisk walk through the aisles you normally skip."

"question": "Have you said something nice to someone in the past day?"
"answer": "Do so, whether online or in person.  Make it genuine; wait until you see something really wonderful about someone, and tell them about it."

"question": "Have you moved your body to music in the past day?"
"answer": "If not, do so — jog for the length of an EDM song at your favorite BPM, or just dance around the room for the length of an upbeat song."

"question": "Have you cuddled a living being in the past two days?"
"answer": "If not, do so.  Don’t be afraid to ask for hugs from friends or friends’ pets.  Most of them will enjoy the cuddles too; you’re not imposing on them."

"answer": "Pause right now and get something small completed, whether it’s responding to an e-mail, loading up the dishwasher, or packing your gym bag for your next trip.  Good job!"

"question": "Do you feel unattractive?"
"answer": "Take a goddamn selfie.  Your friends will remind you how great you look, and you’ll fight society’s restrictions on what beauty can look like."

"question": "Do you feel overwhelmed and/or paralyzed by indecision?"
"answer": "Give yourself ten minutes to sit back and figure out a game plan for the day.  If a particular decision or problem is still being a roadblock, simply set it aside for now, and pick something else that seems doable.  Right now, the important part is to break through that stasis, even if it means doing something trivial."

"question": "Have you seen a therapist in the past few days?"
"answer": "If not, hang on until your next therapy visit and talk through things then."

"question": "Have you been over-exerting yourself lately — physically, emotionally, socially, or intellectually?"

"question": "Have you changed any of your medications in the past couple of weeks, including skipped doses or change in generic prescription brand?"
"That may be screwing with your head.  Give things a few days, then talk to your doctor if it doesn’t settle down."

"question": "Have you waited a week?"
"answer": "Sometimes our perception of life is skewed, and we can’t even tell that we’re not thinking clearly, and there’s no obvious external cause.  It happens.  Keep yourself going for a full week, whatever it takes, and see if you still feel the same way then."
"quotes": [
{
  "mrRogers": "When I say it’s you I like, I’m talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "I think everybody longs to be loved, and longs to know that he or she is lovable. And, consequently, the greatest thing that we can do is to help somebody know that they’re loved and capable of loving."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "You know, you don’t have to look like everybody else to be acceptable and to feel acceptable."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Knowing that we can be loved exactly as we are gives us all the best opportunity for growing into the healthiest of people."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Whether we’re a preschooler or a young teen, a graduating college senior or a retired person, we human beings all want to know that we’re acceptable, that our being alive somehow makes a difference in the lives of others."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Love and trust, in the space between what’s said and what’s heard in our life, can make all the difference in the world."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Imagine what our real neighborhoods would be like if each of us offered, as a matter of course, just one kind word to another person. There have been so many stories about the lack of courtesy, the impatience of today’s world, road rage and even restaurant rage. Sometimes, all it takes is one kind word to nourish another person. Think of the ripple effect that can be created when we nourish someone. One kind empathetic word has a wonderful way of turning into many."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’ To this day, especially in times of ‘disaster,’ I remember my mother’s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers–so many caring people in this world."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Our world hangs like a magnificent jewel in the vastness of space. Every one of us is a part of that jewel. A facet of that jewel. And in the perspective of infinity, our differences are infinitesimal."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "The thing I remember best about successful people I’ve met all through the years is their obvious delight in what they’re doing and it seems to have very little to do with worldly success. They just love what they’re doing, and they love it in front of others."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "There are three ways to ultimate success:The first way is to be kind.The second way is to be kind. The third way is to be kind."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "If only you could sense how important you are to the lives of those you meet; how important you can be to people you may never even dream of. There is something of yourself that you leave at every meeting with another person."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Life is for service."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "I hope you’re proud of yourself for the times you’ve said ‘yes,’ when all it meant was extra work for you and was seemingly helpful only to somebody else."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "The greatest gift you ever give is your honest self."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "We need to help people to discover the true meaning of love. Love is generally confused with dependence. Those of us who have grown in true love know that we can love only in proportion to our capacity for independence."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "I believe that appreciation is a holy thing, that when we look for what’s best in the person we happen to be with at the moment, we’re doing what God does; so in appreciating our neighbor, we’re participating in something truly sacred."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "There is no normal life that is free of pain. It’s the very wrestling with our problems that can be the impetus for our growth."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Confronting our feelings and giving them appropriate expression always takes strength, not weakness. It takes strength to acknowledge our anger, and sometimes more strength yet to curb the aggressive urges anger may bring and to channel them into nonviolent outlets. It takes strength to face our sadness and to grieve and to let our grief and our anger flow in tears when they need to. It takes strength to talk about our feelings and to reach out for help and comfort when we need it."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "It always helps to have people we love beside us when we have to do difficult things in life."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "When I was very young, most of my childhood heroes wore capes, flew through the air, or picked up buildings with one arm. They were spectacular and got a lot of attention. But as I grew, my heroes changed, so that now I can honestly say that anyone who does anything to help a child is a hero to me."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It’s easy to say, ‘It’s not my child, not my community, not my world, not my problem.’ Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people my heroes."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "When we treat children’s play as seriously as it deserves, we are helping them feel the joy that’s to be found in the creative spirit. It’s the things we play with and the people who help us play that make a great difference in our lives."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Anyone who has ever been able to sustain good work has had at least one person–and often many–who have believed in him or her. We just don’t get to be competent human beings without a lot of different investments from others."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "What matters isn’t how a person’s inner life finally puts together the alphabet and numbers of his outer life. What really matters is whether he uses the alphabet for the declaration of a war or the description of a sunrise–his numbers for the final count at Buchenwald or the specifics of a brand-new bridge."
},
{
  "mrRogers": "Often when you think you’re at the end of something, you’re at the beginning of something else."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "What we know matters but who we are matters more."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "If you trade your authenticity for safety, you may experience the following: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, addiction, rage, blame, resentment, and inexplicable grief."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Staying vulnerable is a risk we have to take if we want to experience connection."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Imperfections are not inadequacies; they are reminders that we’re all in this together."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Don’t try to win over the haters; you are not a jackass whisperer."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "You are imperfect, you are wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they’re never weakness."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "The dark does not destroy the light; it defines it. It’s our fear of the dark that casts our joy into the shadows."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "To love someone fiercely, to believe in something with your whole heart, to celebrate a fleeting moment in time, to fully engage in a life that doesn’t come with guarantees – these are risks that involve vulnerability and often pain. But, I’m learning that recognizing and leaning into the discomfort of vulnerability teaches us how to live with joy, gratitude and grace."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Faith is a place of mystery, where we find the courage to believe in what we cannot see and the strength to let go of our fear of uncertainty."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path."

},
{
  "breneBrown": "Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "I now see how owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we will ever do."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Want to be happy? Stop trying to be perfect."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Everyone wants to know why customer service has gone to hell in a handbasket. I want to know why customer behavior has gone to hell in a handbasket."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "To love ourselves and support each other in the process of becoming real is perhaps the greatest single act of daring greatly."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Nothing has transformed my life more than realizing that it’s a waste of time to evaluate my worthiness by weighing the reaction of the people in the stands."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "We risk missing out on joy when we get too busy chasing down the extraordinary."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Talk about your failures without apologizing."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "It’s not about ‘what can I accomplish?’ but ‘what do I want to accomplish?’ Paradigm shift."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Connection is why we’re here; it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "To me, a leader is someone who holds her- or himself accountable for finding potential in people and processes."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Authenticity is a collection of choices that we have to make every day."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "When we work from a place, I believe, that says ‘I’m enough,’ then we stop screaming and start listening, we’re kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we’re kinder and gentler to ourselves."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Those who have a strong sense of love and belonging have the courage to be imperfect."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves even when we risk disappointing others."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Imperfections are not inadequacies; they are reminders that we’re all in this together."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Authenticity is the daily practice of letting go of who we think we’re supposed to be and embracing who we are."
},
{
  "breneBrown": "Joy comes to us in ordinary moments. We risk missing out when we get too busy chasing down the extraordinary."

“
It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which
case you have failed by
default.”―J.K.Rowling
“And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.” ― Haruki Murakami
